We've had some great guests on our podcast, and we've asked each of them for their "Three Top Tips" for new developers. All their advice has been amazing, and a lot of the same concepts have come up time and time again. In this miniseries we're looking back at those top tips, and linking the themes together.

This week our theme is "pragmatic learning". There are lots of routes into this industry, and an overwhelming number of things to start learning. Taking a step back to focus on some of the core competencies can be invaluable. So why should you focus on languages rather than frameworks? And what's wrong with copy/paste development (spoiler alert: _nothing!_). Where can you go to learn the things you need to learn? And why should you avoid specializing too early? Find out all this and more in this week's rehashed instalment of A Question of Code.
