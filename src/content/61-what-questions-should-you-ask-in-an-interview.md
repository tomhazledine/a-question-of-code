Let's set the scene. You've landed an interview for your dream job in tech. You've crushed it on the technical evaluation and wowed them at the whiteboard; everything's going your way. At that point, somewhere towards the end of the face-to-face segment, you'll be hit with the following challenge: do you have any questions for _us_?

We _love_ questions here at A Question of Code (surprise, surprise), so of course we've got some advice for that inevitable scenario. There are some great questions to ask prospective employers, and some more risky ones too. So what should you ask your interviewers when you're being interviewed? Is it a good idea to "get all up in their face"? And how can you turn the situation to your own advantage? Find out all this and more in this week's questionable instalment of A Question of Code.
