---

We're trying something new this week. Live-coding is famously risky when giving a talk or presentation, but we figured it might be fun to make things even harder by removing all the visual elements. That's right; we're live coding on a podcast!

There are a lot of frontend frameworks out there, so being comfortable picking up a new framework is a useful skill to have. To demonstrate and demystify this process, we've picked a framework neither of us have ever used before: Svelte. In this episode we get to "hello, world!" and beyond, and explain how we normally approach the process of learning a new framework.

What are "ah ha!" moments, and how often do they come along? What does `npm install` even mean?! What have we learned about Svelte, and what would our next steps be? Find out all this and more in this week's risky instalment of A Question of Code.
