We've had some great guests on our podcast, and we've asked each of them for their "Three Top Tips" for new developers. All their advice has been amazing, and a lot of the same concepts have come up time and time again. In this miniseries we're looking back at those top tips, and linking the themes together.

This week our theme is "enjoyment". How do you work out what parts of the job you enjoy most? And how should that knowledge steer your next steps? Find out all this and more in this week's rehashed instalment of A Question of Code.
