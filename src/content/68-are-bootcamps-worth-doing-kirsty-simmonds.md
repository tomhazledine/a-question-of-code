This week we're joined by Kirsty Simmonds, a developer who has successfully survived a coding bootcamp. We love hearing stories about people who have transitioned into tech from other careers, and Kirsty's tale is a good one.

As well as giving us an honest and fair insight into the mechanics and specifics of taking a bootcamp, Kirsty also has a ton of actionable advice for other people in a similar situation. In fact, it's all good advice for *all* of us. What parts of the traditional coding job-application did she find worked the best? What are the red (and green) flags you should watch out for when interviewing? And what tips does she have for those of us staring down the barrel of a take-home technical challenge? Find out all this and more in this week's outstanding instalment of A Question of Code.
