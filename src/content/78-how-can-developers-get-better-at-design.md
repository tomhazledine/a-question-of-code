If you're a developer you should absolutely know a little bit about design. You don't need to be an expert, but knowing some of the fundamentals of good layout and "usability" will be a massive force multiplier for your work. It's also a general "life hack" that will improve your career in many, many ways.

So what should you do if you're a developer who doesn't know anything about design? How does design fit into a normal project's workflow? Can you get 80% of the benefit by just learning a few simple rules? (Spoiler alert: we think you can!) And where are some good places for developers to learn more about "designing" for apps and the web? Find out all this and more in this week's well designed instalment of A Question of Code.
