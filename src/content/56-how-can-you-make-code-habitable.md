It is easy to think that when you are writing code your target audience is a computer. But almost all code is more than a simple list of instructions for a machine to follow. A mature codebase is a living, breathing thing that gets touched by many, many developers. So how do we go about writing our code for _humans_?

What does "habitability" mean in a code context? How does the Broken Windows theory transfer to the code you write? And why should you avoid "code golf" at all costs? Find out all this and more in this week's locked-down instalment of A Question of Code.
