What's this? Another of our heroes joining us for a chat!? You betcha! This week we're joined by the immensely talented and infectiously friendly Vaidehi Joshi. You'll know Vaidehi from her work on the Base.cs blog series and podcast (a must-listen show; it's awesome).

How did Vaidehi get into the world of computer science in the first place? And is it something she thinks everyone else should do, too? Are technical interviews that lean heavily on core CS skills useful in a world where most developers _don't_ use them in their day-to-day work? (Spoiler alert: the system needs some improvements) And where can you go to improve your CS knowledge? Find out all this and more in this week's CS-friendly instalment of A Question of Code.
