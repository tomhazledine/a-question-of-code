summary: "This advice is often given without thinking. But is it still valid? Is telling someone to become a developer still a good idea?"
---

Down on your luck? Become a developer! Don't know what to do for a career? Become a developer! Want to earn the big bucks? "Simply" become a developer... We hear this advice all the time, but how much truth is there to it? Can anyone become a developer, and is it a good choice for everyone? And more importantly, is *now* a good time to transition to a career in programming?

We touch a lot of bases in this episode. We ask (again!) if there is a benefit to having a computer science degree, and touch on some hot drama™️ when Ed questions if HTML is a programming language. We also ruminate on the approachability of the frontend. Is it easier than ever to get started creating websites, and is the first-time experience better now for backenders, maybe? And how does the recent explosion in remote working affect junior developers looking for their first gig? Find out all this and more in this week's honest instalment of A Question of Code.
