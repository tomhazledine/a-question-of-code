We were joined for this episode by Tom Sainsbury, a neuroscientist who has a wealth of experience in using programming to deal with data. We discuss the ins and outs of "data science" as a discipline, as well as how it intersects with the world of professional programming.

How do you deal with your data when you're collecting 500GB per day? How do scientists interact with code in a lab setting? What uses are there for data science in the wider tech industry? How can you tell a story with data and code? Find out all this and more in this week's scientific instalment of A Question of Code.
