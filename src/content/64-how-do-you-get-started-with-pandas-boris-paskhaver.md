This week we were joined by Boris Paskhaver, who has 240,000 students across 6 courses on the e-learning marketplace Udemy with over 1 million minutes of video content consumed monthly. In our discussion we talk about his upcoming book, *Pandas in Action*, as well as his own transition into coding. Boris was a data analyst before he was a software engineer, and found that Pandas was a great bridge between Excel and Python.

So what actually is "Pandas" (spoiler alert: it's "Excel on Steroids" for Python). Why does Pandas make for such a good introduction to coding in general? And would Boris recommend a bootcamp to other people looking to kickstart their tech career? Find out all this and more in this week's Excel-superseding instalment of A Question of Code.
