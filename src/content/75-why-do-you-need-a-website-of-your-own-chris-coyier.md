It's fan-boy o'clock again this week, as one of Tom's web-heroes joins us for a chat. CSS Trickster and ShopTalkin' podcaster Chris Coyier stopped by for a chat about working as a developer. Chris is full of all sorts of useful advice for aspiring developers. For example, you need some experience before you can know what you want from a job. Learn how to be picky _after_ your first job, but get into the industry as quickly as you can. That way you'll learn so much more that you would if you were working by yourself. Get whatever experience you can, as early as you can.

We cover a lot of ground in this show. Why does having a personal site gives you a massive advantage? (Having your own website puts you ahead of a surprising number of people; it should be table-stakes, but it's not!) And what does job hunting (and running a job board) look like in the time of CoViD? What will working remotely mean for junior devs in the near future? Find out all this and more in this week's CodePen-tastic instalment of A Question of Code.
