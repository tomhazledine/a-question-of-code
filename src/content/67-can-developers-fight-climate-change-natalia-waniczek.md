We're joined for this episode by Natalia Waniczek. Natalia is a web developer building hybrid mobile apps and websites at Elixel. With a passion for environment she's not afraid to voice her opinions and advocate for climate change.

It's easy to assume that working as a web developer doesn't have much of an impact on climate change, but it there are second-order effects that most of us haven't considered. So how does our work impact the environment, and how serious is this impact? What can we do in our day-to-day work to make the situation better? And how can we learn more about this important topic? Find out all this and more in this week's environmental instalment of A Question of Code.
