---

We've had some great guests on our podcast, and we've asked each of them for their "Three Top Tips" for new developers. All their advice has been amazing, and a lot of the same concepts have come up time and time again. In this miniseries we're looking back at those top tips, and linking the themes together.

This week our theme is "documenting what you've learnt". Who benefits when you write about your career progress? Strangers, peers, yourself? (Spoiler: all of the above). What are the less-than-obvious benefits of leaving a paper-trail of your explorations in the world of code? Find out all this and more in this week's rehashed instalment of A Question of Code.
