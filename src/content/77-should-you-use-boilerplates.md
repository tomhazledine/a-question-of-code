Boilerplate code is code that you import into your project to give you a scaffold to build on. It helps get you to the fun stuff faster. Or does it? This week we discuss why you might (or might not) want to use boilerplate, and dig into what parts of our own stacks we think of as being "boilerplate".

Does Ed think that CSS "frameworks" are true boilerplate? And what old-school boilerplate tool rustles Tom's jimmies? What should you use at the start of every project? And where do you draw the line? Find out all this and more in this week's cookie-cutter instalment of A Question of Code.
