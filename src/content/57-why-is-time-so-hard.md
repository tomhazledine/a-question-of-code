This week's episode is another deep-dive into a niche coding topic. This time, we're dealing with time. In short, writing code that deals with times and dates is horrible. We're here to tell you that, as a sensible developer, you should avoid it at all costs.

But if you're unlucky enough to actually _have_ to programme with times and dates, what are some of the common pitfalls? What "gotchas" are lurking in the depths? And how can you deal with them in the most effective way (and hopefully not be driven insane in the process)? Find out all this and more in this week's timely instalment of A Question of Code.
