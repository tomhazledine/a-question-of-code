We've talked about organising conferences before (in [episode #46](https://aquestionofcode.com/46-how-do-you-apply-to-speak-at-a-conference/)). And we've talked about pivoting before as well (way back in [episode #31](https://aquestionofcode.com/31-should-you-pivot-your-career/)). This week we're covering the mother of all pivots; converting a fully-booked in-person conference into a 100% remote event.

So what needs to change when an event moves online? And what do the speakers have to do to adapt? And, perhaps most importantly, how can an event recreate all the "extra curricular" experiences that make attending a conference so valuable? Find out all this and more in this week's indoor instalment of A Question of Code.
