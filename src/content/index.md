Iâ€™m a frontend developer, specializing in complex UI for web apps. I tinker with all sorts of things but my current interests are data-visualisation and web-audio. I enjoy building funny little interactive charts, and I cling onto my music-tech roots by creating FX modules and instruments that exist solely in-browser. But first-and-foremost I make things for the web.

I work as a senior frontend dev at [Cronofy](https://docs.cronofy.com) where we schedule everything for everyone (and we've encountered *almost* every timezone bug imaginable). I co-host the [A Question of Code](https://aqoc.dev) podcast and I spend most of the day glued to Twitter as [@thomashazledine](http://twitter.com/thomashazledine).
