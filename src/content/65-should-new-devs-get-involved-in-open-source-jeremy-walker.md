It's an exciting show for Ed this week. If you've listened to almost any of our previous episodes, you'll have most likely already heard Ed spreading the Good News (TM) about Exercism.io - an education platform that combines coding exercises and online mentoring. Ed's used it for ages, and talks about it any chance he gets. In this episode we get to chat with one of Exercism's co-founders, Jeremy Walker.

So what actually happens on Exercism? Who's it for, and what will they get out of it? What does it mean to learn a new programming language idiomatically? How do you "manage" an online community, and how do you deal with the inevitable Bad Eggs? If you're a developer that wants to get involved in open source, where are good places to start? And what is the etiquette around getting stuck in on GitHub repos? Find out all this and more in this week's exercising instalment of A Question of Code.
