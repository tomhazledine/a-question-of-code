To celebrate our eightieth full episode, we pull back the curtain to show you how the sausage gets made. When we were starting out, "meta" episodes like these were a great way to learn how our podcasting heroes ran their shows. Now, we're not calling ourselves "heroes" just yet, but we've been doing this long enough to have some tidbits of advice for anyone looking at starting their own show.

How much preparation do we do for each episode? (Spoiler alert: very little) What gear and software do we use to record the show? And how much time does it take to edit? Find out all this and more in this week's introverted instalment of A Question of Code.
