summary: "Looking at some of the repeating themes from our guests' Top Tips for new devs. This week: building your own website"
---

We've had some great guests on our podcast, and we've asked each of them for their "Three Top Tips" for new developers. All their advice has been amazing, and a lot of the same concepts have come up time and time again. In this miniseries we're looking back at those top tips, and linking the themes together.

This week our theme is "Just Build Websites". Having a project to guide your learning and apply your knowledge is really useful, especially when you're just starting out (but also useful at every stage of your career). So who thought this was advice worth sharing? Find out all this and more in this week's rehashed instalment of A Question of Code.
