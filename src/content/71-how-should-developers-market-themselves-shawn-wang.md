This week we're joined by Shawn Wang, Senior Developer Advocate at AWS and author of the excellent Coding Career Handbook. Shawn is a career-switcher; he transitioned into tech in his early thirties after a career in finance. He has written a lot about how aspiring devs can better accelerate their careers, and his views are nuanced and full of wisdom that's very relevant to all aQoC listeners (no matter what stage you're at in your career).

What does a "developer advocate" actually do, and how do they split their time between internal coding work and external communication work? What does it mean to learn in public, and how should you apply this concept to your personal brand? And talking of personal brands, how can you best market yourself and choose you domain? And what does that even mean for non-celebrity developers? Find out all this and more in this week's rousing instalment of A Question of Code.
